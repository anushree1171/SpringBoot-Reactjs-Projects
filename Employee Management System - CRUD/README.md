The application seamlessly manages CRUD operations for employee records, integrating Spring Boot for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and React.js for the frontend. The backend architecture revolves around a singular entity class, 'Employee', with dedicated DAO and service classes for efficient management. A comprehensive controller layer handles HTTP CRUD operations effectively. On the frontend, React.js components like 'Header', 'ListEmployee', and 'Footer' form the main page structure, complemented by a form component facilitating employee record addition and updates. Leveraging React hooks such as 'useState', 'useEffect', and 'useParams' optimizes state management and routing. Communication with the backend REST service is facilitated through the Axios library, ensuring smooth interaction between frontend and backend systems.
